= Tests

The test runner is simply a php script run from the terminal that performs some
tasks normally performed by users of your application. It can be configured
to use an alternate database.

There are several tests included in micro framework to test the framework itself.
These can be run by adding a test_table to your database and altering test_config.php
to include these tests.

== Getting started

 * configure the test database and include some tests in test/test_config.php
 * php -f scripts/run_test.php.

== The framework test

For the model test to pass, you need a table called test_table in your test database. 
To create this, run the following sql on your database:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `test_table` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `name` varchar(120) NOT NULL,
  `name2` varchar(120) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
)
